# LED-Intensity-Control-using-Hand-Gestures-with-Arduino
Using hand gestures to regulate an LED's intensity is a fascinating technological application that is demonstrated by this Python-based project. The project reads hand gestures collected by a camera and converts them into different levels of LED brightness using computer vision techniques and Arduino's capabilities.

Key Features:

Utilizes computer vision to detect hand gestures and infer intensity levels.

Integrates with Arduino to control the brightness of an LED.

Employs serial communication between Python and Arduino for seamless interaction.

Offers an intuitive and interactive way to control LED intensity.

Provides sample code for both the Python and Arduino components.
